				The West Kensington Detective Agency are always happy to give a clear quotation based on a clients specific case requirements. We always recommend potential clients make time to speak with us, this allows us to better appreciate the situation, as all private investigations can be very different, we can then give you an informed indication of expenditure and the timescale involved and agree a clear budget. Intime Investigations staff are always sensitive to the client's circumstances and will only offer services we believe will help resolve the situation.

				Having a Professional Pet Detective working with you when your dog is stolen or lost significantly increases the likelihood that you will be reunited with your best friend. If your dog is missing then the chances are that right now you don't know whether your dog is simply running loose or has been stolen. This is why you need an experienced professional investigator to work with you.We will be able to identify immediately whether we are dealing with the theft of your dog or a runaway, which ensures that the most effective plan for recovering your missing dog is implemented as swiftly as possible.

				You know your partner is up to something but cannot prove it - perhaps they have had affairs before and you simply want an excuse to throw them out! Whatever your reason we have the answers "The Honey Trap". Unlike other companies who just specialise in Honeytraps, most of our team are trained investigators in their own right.Many clients who take on our services have failed in these traps before with other agencies due to their partners not being at the right venue at the right time and by using us they have experienced success without the financial and emotional expense of failure because we are professionals with years of experience in the investigation industry.

				Tracing missing people, by it's very nature is a stressful process when you try to go it alone. Irrespective of whether you're trying to track down an old friend, an adopted child or a lover who's left a gap in your heart for years, the search can seem relentless.We are committed to listening and giving guidance and advice to all the people who contact us, as well as acting on behalf of those who do become the client of one of our Private Investigators. This is so much the case that we often help the people who contact us to find solutions without them even having to engage our services. This is why clients and non-clients alike recommend us on a regular basis to friends and contacts who they think may be in need of our services.
